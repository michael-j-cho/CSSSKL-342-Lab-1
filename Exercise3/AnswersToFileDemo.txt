Do you encounter any problems? Does it matter what OS you're developing your code on? 

Yes. When I run the code with the first two text files, the numbers display correctly.
However, when I cout the third text file, none of the numbers show. Using the "od -a textfileX.txt" 
command shows that the files are very different. Although the numbers in the text is the same,
the formatting and hex code varies significatly. On another note, the problems are the same on
both Linux and Windows.
