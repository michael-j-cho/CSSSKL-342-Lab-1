Why doesn't it compile?

Line 55 is a reference int. However, it is not initialized. Reference data types need to be initialized when declaring.

What is happening when onePlus() is called? In other words, what exactly does the function receive as an argument? 

The function receives a copy of whatever integer is passed in. 

Why isn't the value of the variable in main() altered?

The function increments the copy of the variable. It does not change the variable that was passed in. In order to do so,
you need to make it a reference variable.

Conversely, consider the call to refIncrement(). What is the argument here and why is the value of the variable in main()
changed?

It is different because the argument passed in is the reference of the variable. Therefore, any changes to the value will
change the variables reference data and change the original value.

Next, consider a call to value(). What does the function receive as an argument? What is the meaning of const in this 
context?

The function receives a constant reference string. Therefore, the function cannot change the value of the string.

What does value() return? How can it be legal and what does it mean to apply the ++operator to its return value?

value() returns an integer. It is getting the integer from the Pair struct. You cannot ++ the return because 
&int means it's returning a named variable or lvalue. It cannot return a regular integer.
